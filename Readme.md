# E-commerce Company analysis

## Project Overview 

**Project Title**: E-commerce Company analysis

**DataBase**: `e-commerce_analysis`

This project showcases SQL skills commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze E-commerce data. It involves creating an e-commerce_analysis database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering key business questions using SQL queries. This project is perfect for Intermediate who want to build a strong foundation in SQL and data analysis.

## Objectives
1. Customer Insights look at the Customers and Orders data.
Questions:
Who are our top customers?
Who buys repeatedly?
Which location has the most sales?
Purpose: Helps marketing target the right people.

2. Product Analysis look at Products and OrderDetails.
Questions:
Which products sell the most?
Which products make the most money?
Are there products that rarely sell?
Purpose: Helps decide what to stock, promote, or remove.

3. Sales Optimization look at Orders and OrderDetails.
Questions:
Which months have the highest sales?
Are there trends in customer buying habits?
How can we increase revenue?
Purpose: Helps boost sales and improve strategy.

4. Inventory Management look at Products and OrderDetails.
Questions:
Which products are running low in stock?
Which products are overstocked?
Purpose: Helps avoid running out of popular items or wasting money on slow items.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- ** Database Creation **: The project starts by creating a database named `e-commerce_analysis`
- ** Table Importing **: The table names `customers`, `orderdetails`, `orders`, and `products`.

## What you actually do with SQL
- Extract data from the tables (Customers, Products, Orders, OrderDetails).
- Clean and organize the data (remove duplicates, fix mistakes).
- Analyze using queries like SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, JOINs.
- Generate reports or insights that departments can use to make decisions.

-- Here first i changed date format string to proper date format yyyy-mm-dd
update  orders 
set order_date = STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%Y/%m/%d');

select month(o.order_date) as Months, sum(od.quantity * od.price_per_unit) as total_sale_amount

-- Q<2> Are there trends in customer buying habits?

-- 1. Which months have the most orders (Seasonal trend)
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%M') AS Month_Name,

GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- 3. By improving sales during low-performing months through seasonal discounts or marketing campaigns.

group by Months
order by total_sale_amount;



-- Objective 4 :
-- Inventory Management look at Products and OrderDetails.
-- Purpose: Helps avoid running out of popular items or wasting money on slow items.

-- Questions :
-- Q<1> Which products are running low in stock?
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM products p
JOIN orderdetails od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;  -- top 10 fast-selling products
-- Shows products that are selling the most, these are most likely to run low soon.


-- Q<2> Which products are overstocked?
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orderdetails od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name
ORDER BY total_sold ASC
LIMIT 10;  -- bottom 10 slow-selling products
-- Shows products that sell very less, these are least likely to run low and may indicate overstock.
